# Memory-Game

Link to the [game](https://memory-game-73.netlify.app/)

This project showcases my basic DOM manipulation skills and uses the following stack:
- Javascript
- CSS
- HTML

## How the game works
- The game does not play until a board size is selected
- The amount of cards to match are determined by the board size selected
- When two cards which are distinct are selected they will be face down after some time and then can be matched again
- When two cards which are identical are selected they will remain facing up for the rest of the game
- Once all the cards are matched, a popup will show indicating how many moves and the time it took to complete the game
